We are committed to providing a friendly, safe, and welcoming environment for all, and we expect everyone who participates in our community to share these values.

- Public or private harassment.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission.

## **Our Responsibilities**

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct, and they may temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## **Scope**

It also applies in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing the project include using an official project email address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## **Enforcement**

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project team is obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident and will not disclose personal information without explicit consent.
